# Exploit Script Documentation

## Overview

This Ruby script serves as an exploit module designed to take advantage of a specific vulnerability in a target system. The script establishes a network socket connection to the target and orchestrates the execution of a series of commands to achieve a specific exploit scenario.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby must be installed on the system where the script is executed.
- The target system must be reachable over the network.

## Usage

```bash
ruby exploit.rb <target-ip> <local-http-server-ip> <payload-name>
